# Kalvium Lab | Search Box with keys

### Learning Goals:

The aim of this lab is to experiment to use keyboard keys for certain functionality.
You can use the data provided inside `resources/countryData.json` file.


### Task 1:

Your task is to create a search box which which gives all possible suggestions -> when given some inital text in the given search box. Like shown below:

Use `hooks` to manage states.

### Task 2:

As shown in the above reference gif, when we press `escape` key, the dropdown hides. You have to implement the same: when you press `escape` key -> the suggestions should not be visible.

Happy Coding ❤️!


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
